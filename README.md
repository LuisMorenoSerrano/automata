- **JFLAP8_beta.jar**: Beta version of JFLAP

### 4-Tools/

Utility scripts and automation tools:

- **compress_videos.sh**: Script for compressing MP4 video files to optimize repository size

### 5-Certification/

- Coursera Automata certification (2015)

## üîß Tools and Technologies

- **JFLAP**: For designing and testing automata, grammars, and Turing machines
- **Graphviz**: For creating visual representations of automata (.gv files)
- **LaTeX**: For mathematical documentation and problem solutions
- **Java/Python**: Programming assignments implementation
- **FFmpeg**: Video compression tool (used by automation scripts)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Runtime Environment (for JFLAP)
- LaTeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX, etc.)
- Graphviz (for .gv file visualization)
- Python 3.x or Java 8+ (for programming assignments)

### Running JFLAP

```bash
java -jar 3-Software/JFLAP.jar
```

### Compiling LaTeX Documents

```bash
pdflatex document_name.tex
```

### Generating Graphviz Images

```bash
dot -Tpng filename.gv -o filename.png
```

### Using Project Tools

The repository includes automation scripts in the `4-Tools/` directory:

**Video Compression:**

```bash
# Navigate to project root and run compression script
cd /path/to/Automata
bash 4-Tools/compress_videos.sh
```

This script automatically compresses all MP4 files in the project to optimize repository size while maintaining acceptable quality.

## üìñ Course Topics Covered

- **Finite Automata**: DFA, NFA, Œµ-NFA
- **Regular Languages**: Regular expressions, pumping lemma
- **Context-Free Languages**: CFG, PDA, parsing
- **Turing Machines**: TM variants, decidability
- **Complexity Theory**: P, NP, NP-completeness
- **Computability Theory**: Undecidability, reduction

## üéØ Key Features

- **Interactive Learning**: JFLAP files for hands-on automata design
- **Visual Representations**: Graphviz diagrams for better understanding
- **Multiple Formats**: Problems available in various formats (PDF, LaTeX, JFLAP)
